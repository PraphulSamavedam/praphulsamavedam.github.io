Maintained Nvidia's internal ARM simulator to support newly added features in ARM v8.x for the **Caramel CPU** and **Volta GPU** to achieve ARM compliance.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and executed test plans for **Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (R.A.S)** features
- Validated on bare silicon (bare-metal tests), with hypervisor, and system on chip (SoC) configurations
- Presented compliance results to the computing wing team for ARM certification

## Technical Stack

- **ISA & Architecture:** ARM v8.x instruction set architecture (ARMv8.2-A extensions), AArch64 execution state
- **Languages:** C (bare-metal test development), Python (test automation and result parsing), Assembly (ARM A64 for targeted instruction-level tests)
- **Toolchain:** GCC cross-compilation toolchain for ARM targets, GNU Make build system
- **Hardware Context:** Verilog/SystemVerilog (RTL-level understanding for tracing compliance gaps), JTAG debugging
- **Validation Environments:** Bare silicon (pre-OS), hypervisor-managed VMs, full SoC boot configurations
- **Infrastructure:** Internal CI/CD pipelines for regression testing, proprietary ARM simulator maintained by Nvidia's CPU team

## Quantified Impact

- Authored and validated **100+ test vectors** targeting R.A.S features across exception levels (EL0-EL3)
- Achieved **full ARM compliance coverage** for the targeted R.A.S feature set on Caramel CPU and Volta GPU configurations
- Reduced manual validation effort by automating test execution and result aggregation via Python scripts, cutting turnaround time for compliance reporting by an estimated **40-50%**
- Contributed to the compliance milestone that enabled ARM certification sign-off for the Volta GPU computing wing
- Identified and documented **multiple edge-case failures** in hypervisor-mediated exception routing, which were escalated to the RTL design team for resolution

## Growth & Relevance to Current Work

- **GPU architecture fundamentals:** Working at the intersection of CPU-GPU interaction on Volta gave me a deep understanding of how GPU compute pipelines are orchestrated — knowledge that directly applies to optimizing distributed ML training workloads across GPU clusters at Amazon AGI.
- **Low-level systems thinking:** Writing bare-metal tests and debugging at the instruction level built a habit of reasoning about hardware constraints (memory hierarchy, cache coherence, interrupt handling) that informs how I approach performance-critical ML infrastructure today.
- **ARM ecosystem expertise:** Understanding ARM's exception model and privilege levels translates to working with ARM-based inference accelerators (e.g., AWS Graviton, custom silicon) and optimizing model serving for heterogeneous compute environments.
- **Validation rigor:** The discipline of exhaustive compliance testing — covering corner cases, documenting evidence, and presenting results to stakeholders — carries directly into how I approach testing distributed systems for correctness and reliability.
